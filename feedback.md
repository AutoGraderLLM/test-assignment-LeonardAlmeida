# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and suggestions for the student:

**time_conversion.c:**

1. What is the issue with the `atoi` function in this code? According to the Autograder Output, it's giving a warning about an implicit declaration.
2. How can you fix this warning by adding a necessary header file or using a different function?
3. The program seems to be working fine after fixing the warning. However, it's not printing the result in the desired format (**X hours Y minutes**). What changes do you need to make to achieve this?

**product.c:**

1. There are two errors related to the `product` variable in this code. According to the Autograder Output, they're both about expected commas or semicolons before the `int` declaration.
2. How can you fix these errors by adding necessary commas or semicolons?
3. The program is also failing because it's trying to print the result with an array that hasn't been initialized properly. What changes do you need to make to initialize the `numbers` array correctly and calculate its sum and product?

**General Suggestions:**

1. Make sure to check the Autograder Output carefully for any other warnings or errors that might be related to your code.
2. Review the Professor Instructions again to ensure you understand all the requirements for both programming tasks.
3. Consider using a debugger or printing intermediate values to help diagnose any issues with your code.

By addressing these questions and suggestions, the student should be able to identify and fix the issues in their code and complete the assignment successfully.
