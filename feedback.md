# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions for the student:

**time_conversion.c:**

1. What is the issue with the `atoi` function in the program? According to the Autograder Output, what error message is reported?
2. How can you fix the warning about implicit declaration of the `atoi` function?

**product.c:**

1. What are the two errors reported by the Autograder Output for this program? Can you identify which lines of code are causing these errors?
2. Why do you think the compiler is complaining about the `product` variable being declared twice in the same scope?
3. How can you fix both of these errors to make the program compile successfully?

**General:**

1. Review the Professor Instructions for Assignment 2 and ensure that your implementation of **time_conversion.c** meets all the requirements specified.
2. For **product.c**, double-check that your implementation correctly reads the integers from the text file, calculates their sum and product, and prints the results to console as required.

By addressing these questions, the student should be able to identify and fix the issues reported by the Autograder Output and ensure that their code meets all the requirements specified in the Professor Instructions.
