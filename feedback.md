# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions for the student:

1. What is the error message displayed in the Autograder Output for the `i2b.c` file? How does it relate to the code?

2. Identify the line numbers where the errors occur in the `i2b.c` file. What kind of errors are they (syntax, logical, etc.)?

3. In the `i2b.c` file, what is the issue with the variable `binRep`? How can it be fixed?

4. The Autograder Output also mentions that the binary representation test fails for negative numbers. Explain why this might be happening.

5. Based on Professor Instructions, how should the `i2b.c` file be modified to accept a single command line argument and convert it into its corresponding binary representation?

6. What are the conditions specified for the binary representation in Professor Instructions? How can these conditions be implemented in the code?

7. Create a copy of `i2b.c` called `i2h.c`. Modify `i2h.c` to satisfy the specifications given in Professor Instructions for converting an integer into its corresponding machine's hexadecimal representation.

8. In `i2h.c`, what are the conditions specified for the hexadecimal representation? How can these conditions be implemented in the code?

9. Based on Professor Instructions, how should the output of both `i2b.c` and `i2h.c` files be printed without any spaces between the bits or digits?

10. Make sure to edit the README.md file with your name at the top before submitting the assignment through GitHub Classroom.
